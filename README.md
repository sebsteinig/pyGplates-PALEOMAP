# pyGplates-PALEOMAP

This repo contains an example notebooka and all necessary files to reconstruct paleolocations that are consistent with the PALEOMAP rotation model (https://www.earthbyte.org/paleomap-paleoatlas-for-gplates/) for a list of modern input sites. Scripting is done in Python and makes use of the pyGplates software (https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/). 

Please note: pyGplates need to be installed on your system as a seperate Python library and linked to in the script. This notebook was used on macOS, information on how to install it on other systems can be found here: https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/pygplates_getting_started.html#id21
